# Individual-Self-Assessment
Self assessment 
Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes the role(s) they played over the course of the project and their contribution to the project in that role. Presents a cohesive written summary of how they contributed to each of the roles they did not take on via team discussions, peer reviews, or other means. Additionally, the analysis should describe their greatest personal challenge over the course of the project, and how they overcame that challenge.



This project took a look at beer reviews. During the project my part of the project included cleaning and changing the data sets. Replacing columns, remaining tables. I looked for data sets that would match our project details. We were able to pull 2 data sets for beer reviews and beer profiles. I made sure the data would pull correctly to SQL Pgadmin and we established a connection to pd.read. My team worked well together and I was able to learn a lot from their knowledge. We met many times to look over and review, spending many hours outside of class to make sure our project was up to date and compliant with the deliverables presented to us. The biggest challenge I had was being able to show some of my ideas and had to pivit many times in the project to get the right question and data to match. We overcame this challenge by evaluating our options and finding what data sets would match closest to the machine learning data modal. 


Group assessment 
Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes their teamwork, including all of the following: ✓ Their communication protocol, including any challenges, how they were resolved, and what they would do differently next time ✓ Their strengths as a team, including tips and tricks they would want to share with a new cohort kicking off the project

Andrew - Andrew is very intelligent and is a great team member. He was good at communicating what needed to be done and worked with me to solve challenges and provide input. Andrews strength is his ability to lead the team and make decisions for the group. Very streamlined. Needs to work on explaining his ideas and presenting them to the group before implementing. 

Sam - spent many hours working with Sam on the data models and machine learning models. Takes the time to listen and expresses her opinion. We had a challenge with finding the right visualizations to usd. We worked as a team to talk about our ideas and how well they would fit when describing the project dashboard. 


Summary of Project 
Presents a cohesive, three- to four-sentence summary of the project that could be used on a LinkedIn profile, in an interview or cover letter, or as an elevator pitch, including all of the following: ✓ Topic addressed ✓ Machine module used ✓ Results of the analysis
The scope of the project is the flavor profile of successful beers. 
The dataset used, Beer Profile and Ratings dataset, is a combination of two datasets. The first contains flavor profiles of successful beers and the second contains over a million reviews of beers.
We used a supervised  machine learning model using random forest classifiers from scikit learn. We chose this because we were able to obtain a stable and accurate model.
 
The data was used to analyze what contributes to the high rating for a beer overall and looked into specific styles of beer looking for an understanding why beers get rated
